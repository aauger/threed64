# threed64
A .NET 6.0 rendition of some classic 3D WinForms controls.
![Sample](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aauger/threed64/master/netthreed64.png)
These are not at feature-parity, but rather some fun & simple examples of custom painting. 
Anyone who has tried to use the old threed.ocx/threed32.ocx/activethreed controls will know how painful that experience is
even with the interoperability tools.
